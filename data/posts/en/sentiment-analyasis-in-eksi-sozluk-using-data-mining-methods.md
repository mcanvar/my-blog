I finally decided to share my bachelor thesis part by part. Here is the abstract:

“Social Media” is a term that we met a couple of years ago, however Ekşi Sözlük has been fulfilling the need for social platform of Turkey for many years. Today, it has become a platform that written by thousands of users and read by hundreds of thousands visitors.

In simple terms, Ekşi Sözlük is an internet dictionary and it includes topic titles consisting of words and short sentences. The users of this platform can define these titles and write whatever they want. In this way, Ekşi Sözlük becomes more flexible, and of course more likeable, than other platforms. On the other hand, there is a huge amount of information flow and this situation brings some difficulties to usage of the dictionary.

There are lots of titles and lots of unnecessary comments under of these topics and sometimes readers do not want to see these useless information. While they were trying to sort the entries, they ended up with waste of time and unsatisfaction. Because of this problem, users need to reach entries that more valuable and reliable. In this context, our aim is providing the best quality of content to the users by using data mining methods.

With this process we can filter the instant, valued information and analyse the sentiment of the entries. In this way, users can reach titles and comments as measured in terms of sentiment without any waste of time and they can be more pleased by service of this platform.
